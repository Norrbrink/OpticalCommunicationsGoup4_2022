# OpticalCommunicationsGoup4_2022
We need to make a readme but so far
Graphical 1 gives us all the plots that we used to make inital guesses

Sophie_graphical1 allows the precise roots, beta and propagation constant for each mode to be calculated but it doesnt remove the DEGENERATE STATES!


Also here is the google doc

USE
jvp(v, z[, n]) to Compute derivatives of Bessel functions of the first kind.


READ ME
Optical Communications contains a file that when run, presents our work for all tasks.

table_task3.csv is a table of the initial guesses of modes from task 3

new_table_task3.csv is a table of the final guesses of the modes determined using a Newton-Raphson roots finder method.
